Use the architect tool to think through and plan all big tasks before implementation. This ensures proper analysis, planning, and consideration of all aspects before taking action.

## Guidelines

- Always use the architect tool for complex features, major refactoring, or multi-step implementations
- Break down big tasks into smaller, manageable components using architect's thinking process
- Use architect to analyze requirements, consider edge cases, and plan the implementation approach
- Let architect help identify potential issues, dependencies, and the optimal sequence of steps
- For simple, single-file changes or minor tweaks, architect may not be necessary
