# Tab Bar Icon Requirements

Please download the following icons and place them in the `assets/images/` directory with the specified filenames.

The recommended dimensions for tab bar icons are **48x48 pixels**.

| Icon Name  | Filename         | Search Term (e.g., on Google Images)           |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Home       | `home.png`       | "material design icon home outlined"           |
| Vocabulary | `vocabulary.png` | "material design icon school outlined"         |
| Exercises  | `exercises.png`  | "material design icon fitness center outlined" |
| Settings   | `settings.png`   | "material design icon settings outlined"       |

Once you have downloaded and placed all the icons in the `assets/images/` directory, please let me know so I can proceed with the implementation.
